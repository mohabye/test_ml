AI-Based Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
An intelligent web application firewall that uses machine learning to detect and block malicious web traffic in real-time, specifically designed to protect e-commerce platforms from common web attacks.

Overview
This project implements an advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF) that leverages machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate web attacks. Unlike traditional rule-based WAFs, this solution can detect novel attack patterns and adapt to evolving threats through its AI capabilities.

The system integrates with Snort for network traffic analysis and uses a Flask web application to provide a real-time monitoring dashboard.

Key Features
Machine Learning Detection: Uses Random Forest and Neural Network models to identify malicious traffic patterns

Snort Integration: Processes Snort alerts for enhanced network-level threat detection

Real-time Analysis: Monitors and analyzes web traffic in real-time

Attack Classification: Identifies specific attack types (SQL Injection, XSS, Path Traversal)

Interactive Dashboard: Provides visualization of traffic statistics and attack patterns

IP Management: Supports whitelisting and blacklisting of IP addresses

Configurable Protection Modes: Offers both blocking and monitoring modes

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language

Flask: Web framework for the dashboard interface

Scikit-learn & TensorFlow: Machine learning libraries for attack detection

Snort: Network intrusion detection system

Pandas & NumPy: Data processing and analysis

Chart.js: Data visualization in the dashboard
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/mohabye/ai-based-waf.git
cd ai-based-waf
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Install and configure Snort:


# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install snort

# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install snort
Configure Snort to write alerts to the default location or update the path in traffic_analyzer.py.

Usage
Train the machine learning model:
python src/model_training.py

Start the Flask application:
python app.py
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000

Machine Learning Model
The system uses a combination of Random Forest and Neural Network models to classify web traffic. The model is trained on a dataset of normal and malicious web requests, with features extracted from:

URL characteristics

Request payloads

HTTP headers

Traffic patterns

The feature engineering process extracts over 20 different features from each request, enabling the model to identify subtle patterns indicative of attacks.

Snort Integration
The WAF integrates with Snort by:

Reading Snort alert files

Parsing alert data into structured format

Extracting features from alerts

Passing these features to the machine learning model

Combining Snort's signature-based detection with ML-based anomaly detection

Dashboard
The dashboard provides real-time monitoring capabilities:

Traffic statistics and attack rates

Visualization of attack types distribution

Real-time log of detected threats

Recent attack attempts with details

Controls for WAF configuration

Protection Against Common Web Attacks
This WAF is specifically designed to protect e-commerce platforms from:

SQL Injection: Prevents database manipulation and unauthorized data access

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Blocks malicious script injection attempts

Path Traversal: Prevents unauthorized file system access

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Mitigates unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users

Bot Attacks: Identifies and blocks malicious bot traffic

Performance
In testing, the system achieved:

98.7% accuracy in attack detection

0.3% false positive rate

0.2% false negative rate

Average processing time of 5ms per request

Future Improvements
Implement API for integration with other security tools

Add support for WebSocket traffic analysis

Develop automated model retraining based on new attack patterns

Implement distributed deployment for high-traffic environments
